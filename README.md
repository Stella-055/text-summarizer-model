# Pegasus Summarization Model 

## Overview  
This document provides an overview of using the Pegasus model for text summarization. The implementation involves loading a dataset, training the model, evaluating its performance, and generating summaries from dialogues.  

## Installation and Setup  
To use the Pegasus model, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed, including Transformers, Datasets, and evaluation metrics such as ROUGE. The model runs on GPU if available.  

## Dataset  
The Samsum dataset is used for training and evaluation. It consists of dialogues and their corresponding summaries. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to fit the model's input requirements.  

## Model and Tokenization  
Pegasus is a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model designed for abstractive text summarization. The tokenizer processes input dialogues by truncating and encoding them, ensuring they fit within the modelâ€™s constraints.  

## Training  
The dataset is tokenized and formatted before being fed into the model. The training process involves setting hyperparameters such as batch size, number of training epochs, and learning rate. Gradient accumulation is used to optimize performance on smaller GPUs.  

## Evaluation  
The model's performance is assessed using the ROUGE metric, which compares generated summaries to reference summaries. The evaluation involves batch processing and decoding outputs to compute precision, recall, and F1 scores.  

## Saving and Loading the Model  
Once trained, the model and tokenizer are saved for future use. They can be reloaded to generate summaries without requiring retraining.  

## Generating Summaries  
The trained model is used to generate summaries for new dialogues. The generation process involves setting parameters such as length penalty and beam search to optimize summary quality.  

## Results and Observations  
The model produces concise and coherent summaries of dialogues. The evaluation results indicate the effectiveness of fine-tuning Pegasus on the Samsum dataset. Adjusting hyperparameters and dataset size can further improve performance.  

## Conclusion  
This implementation demonstrates the ability of Pegasus to summarize dialogues effectively. Future improvements can include fine-tuning on domain-specific data or experimenting with different model architectures.
